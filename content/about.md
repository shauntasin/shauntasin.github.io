I build at the intersection of applied AI, automation, and real-world systems.

This space is where I share:

- field notes from experiments
- technical breakdowns in plain language
- practical lessons from building products from idea to deployment

I care about useful technology over hype: things that make decisions clearer, workflows faster, and outcomes better for people on the ground.

If a post is here, it passed one filter: **it had to be actually useful.**
